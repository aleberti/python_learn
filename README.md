python_learn
============

This project's aim is to learn Python writing some code useful in real life (or maybe not... :) )
A first idea is writing a program which manages household accounts, useful for students who live together.
Another idea is writing a "documentation program" for D&D (ask aiace9 for details!).
Other ideas will be implemented on the way.
